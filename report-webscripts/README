The webscript "getContentByTypeInFolder" searches content recursively in a given folder filtering by type.
This project contains an example of custom model which you can use to perform filtered searches. See the model definition in:

- test/resources/alfresco/extension/acme-model.xml
- test/resources/alfresco/extension/ acme-model-context.xml
- test/resources/alfresco/extension/web-client-config.xml

You can use the Content Wizard in Alfresco-Explorer to test searches with content of type "gius:doc_fatture".
